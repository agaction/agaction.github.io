# Facebook AI Applied Research
### Software Engineering Intern, May 2021 - August 2021. *Menlo Park, CA.*

At Facebook, I implemented model interpretability algorithms for [Captum](https://captum.ai/), an open-source PyTorch package. Specifically, I focused on designing and developing a library for a method called [influential instances](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/influential.html) used to to understand the predictions made by machine learning models, based on the data they were trained on. I also created tutorials and applied the algorithms I developed to Facebook AI Multimodal models used for platform integrity.

# Varian Medical Systems
### Software Engineering Intern, May 2020 - August 2020. *Atlanta, GA*

At Varian, I built automized data preprocessing pipeline for developing local deep learning segmentation models. I used this pipeline to develop and test deep volumetric models for organ segmentation within Varian's oncology picture archiving and communication system (PACS), known as Velocity. I also presented my project & pitched call-to-action to panel of Varian executives, receiving a top score for my presentation.

# MIT Lincoln Laboratory
### Summer Research Intern, June 2019 - August 2019, *Lexington, MA*
### Student Technical Researcher, August 2019 - May 2020

At MITLL, I used Monte-Carlo simulations to develop a time-gating algorithm for a novel biomedical imaging technique called Time-Domain Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy. This was a very new and different field of work for me, but extremely interesting and rewarding. I also published a [conference paper](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11216/2545298/Towards-automatic-time-gating-for-time-domain-diffuse-correlation-spectroscopy/10.1117/12.2545298.full?SSO=1) at SPIE Photonics West, San Francisco, February 2020. "Towards Automatic Time-Gating for Time-Domain Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy." I also had a chance to briefly work on a project using convolutional neural network architectures for nuclei segmentation.

During the internship program, we also had an "Innovative Idea Challenge" in which teams of interns got together to form a fleshed out project proposal and pitch it to other interns, employees, and executives in various stages. My team received the 1st place prize and Best Poster award for a proposal on automatic American Sign Language translation. We received funding from MITLL to continue working on the project we had proposed.
