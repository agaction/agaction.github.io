# Facebook AI Applied Research
### Software Engineering Intern, May 2021 - August 2021. *Menlo Park, CA.*

At Facebook, I implemented model interpretability algorithms for [Captum](https://captum.ai/), an open-source PyTorch package. Specifically, I focused on designing and developing a library for a method called [influential instances](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/influential.html) used to to understand the predictions made by machine learning models, based on the data they were trained on. I also created tutorials and applied the algorithms I developed to Facebook AI Multimodal models used for platform integrity.

# Varian Medical Systems
### Software Engineering Intern, May 2020 - August 2020. *Atlanta, GA*

At Varian, I built automized data preprocessing pipeline for developing local deep learning segmentation models. I used this pipeline to develop and test deep volumetric models for organ segmentation within Varian's oncology picture archiving and communication system (PACS), known as Velocity. I also presented my project & pitched call-to-action to panel of Varian executives, receiving a top score for my presentation.
