# Visually Grounded PointGoal Navigation
### [CVMLP Lab](https://mlp.cc.gatech.edu/), August 2021 - Current

I am currently working on a research project aimed at using model saliency methods such as [GRAD-CAM](http://gradcam.cloudcv.org/) to provide additional supervision for pointgoal navigation agents, with the aim of improving their performance in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. I am mentored by [Sameer Dharur](https://sameerdharur.github.io/), [Arjun Majumdar](https://arjunmajum.github.io/), and [Ram Selvaraju](https://ramprs.github.io/). The project is advised by [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/).

# Autonomous Robot Navigation
### [IVALab](https://ivalab.gatech.edu/), Jan 2019 - May 2020

As a new undergraduate student, I spent a few semesters at the IVALab under [Prof. Patricio Vela](http://pvela.gatech.edu)learning about classical controls-based approaches for autonomous navigation, and also learning about reinforcement learning methods and working on applying them for local planners for robotic agents. This was my first experience in a research lab, and it was a very enjoyable and rewarding experience that made me realize how much there is to learn. Some of my favorite memories from my time in the lab are simply listening in to the debates during meetings about different ideas for a project, discussions of prior research, and the cool results and progress being made in the lab. If you are at all remotely interested in research, I highly suggest joining a lab and experiencing this for yourself.
