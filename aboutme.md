Hey! I'm Akhil. 

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I study Math and Computer Science, and have a particular interest in deep learning. Last summer, I worked at Facebook AI Applied Research to work on a model interpretability library called [Captum](https://captum.ai/). I currently work on a project for visually-grounded PointGoal Navigation in the CVMLP lab advised under [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/). You can learn more about my [work](https://agaction.github.io/workexperience/) and [research interests](https://agaction.github.io/research/) on this website!

I have a debilitating inclination for strategy games and puzzles, and can easily get sucked into the more difficult and challenging ones. 

I also have a love for music and photagraphy.
