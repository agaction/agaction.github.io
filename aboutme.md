Hey! I'm Akhil. 

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I study Math and Computer Science, and have a particular interest in deep learning. Last summer, I worked at Facebook AI Applied Research to work on a model interpretability library called [Captum](https://captum.ai/). I currently work on a project for visually-grounded PointGoal Navigation in the CVMLP lab advised under [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/). You can learn more about my [work](https://agaction.github.io/workexperience/) and [research interests](https://agaction.github.io/research/) on this website!

I have a debilitating inclination for strategy games and puzzles, and can easily pour hours upon hours into them. I spent a large portion of my childhood playing chess, though I can't really claim I'm any good these days. I've currently been spending some time into poker, math brainteasers, and algorithm problems. I am also a lifelong Pokemon nerd.

I also take joy in making music and taking pretty pictures. After I stopped playing violin in high school, I eventually realized the hole it had left in my life, and I began learning to play the piano in college. I've also always enjoyed singing (my motivation for picking up piano, albeit also determined by accessibility), but I'm not much of a performer yet. I treasure traveling and experiencing the different joys of life, and cherish these memories in photos. However, I prefer to capture the setting that brings me joy to myself experiencing it - the result is scenic shots of nature and other people, and very little of myself.
